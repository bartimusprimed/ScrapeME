# Scrape ME Swiftly
```
I was doing a pentest the other day and I was disappointed that I could not find a native OS X app that would allow me to type in a domain name and give me email addresses it found on that domain (including all pages on that domain). I just wanted something simple and saved me time. And thus Scrape ME Swiftly was born (It doesn't use any third party libraries). I'm learning swift and thought it would be a good project to help me get my hands dirty. I wrote the html parser from scratch, i'll be working on it more.
